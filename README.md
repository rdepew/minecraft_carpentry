# minecraft_carpentry
Carpentry mod for minecraft. 

# INTRODUCTION
This is a mod I wrote when I was starting to learn Minecraft and MCreator. The first item in the mod is a **datum**, a block that 
can be used as the starting point for a large construction project, or a home marker for when you go exploring.

The JAR file can be found on Modrinth.com. Watch this space for a real URL. For now, search for "Carpentry 0.0.1."
